# eCommerceBackEnd

This is an example of an eCommerce backend with 4 tables tracking products, tags, and categories with a through model called product tags.

The application is only updated with routes and CRUD functions for the category table now. 

Requirements:  
Before running this application, drop and create a database in MySQL, then "npm i" for the package.json to install the scripts for seed, nodemon, and start.

This was challenging but enjoyable. 

Good luck, have fun!
